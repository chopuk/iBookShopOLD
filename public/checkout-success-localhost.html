<!-- Stripe is redirected to this page on a successful transaction. -->
<!-- We then have to redirect to the real ejs page using javascript -->
<!-- This is because Stripe can only redirect to a static html page -->
<!-- Two versions of this page exist. Testing ( localhost ) and production ( irender.com ) -->
<!-- Due to an environment variable on the server side, Stripe knows which one to use. -->
